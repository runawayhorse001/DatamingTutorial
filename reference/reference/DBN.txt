Deep Belief Networks
++++++++++++++++++++

[Hinton06]_ showed that RBMs can be stacked and trained in a greedy manner
to form so-called Deep Belief Networks (DBN). DBNs are graphical models which
learn to extract a deep hierarchical representation of the training data.
They model the joint distribution between observed vector :math:`x` and
the :math:`\ell` hidden layers :math:`h^k` as follows:

.. math::
    :label: dbn
 
    P(x, h^1, \ldots, h^{\ell}) = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{\ell-2} P(h^k|h^{k+1})\right) P(h^{\ell-1},h^{\ell})

where :math:`x=h^0`, :math:`P(h^{k-1} | h^k)` is a conditional distribution
for the visible units conditioned on the hidden units of the RBM at level
:math:`k`, and :math:`P(h^{\ell-1}, h^{\ell})` is the visible-hidden joint
distribution in the top-level RBM. This is illustrated in the figure below.

    :align: center

The principle of greedy layer-wise unsupervised training can be applied to
DBNs with RBMs as the building blocks for each layer [Hinton06]_, [Bengio07]_.
The process is as follows:

1. Train the first layer as an RBM that models the raw input :math:`x =
h^{(0)}` as its visible layer.

2. Use that first layer to obtain a representation of the input that will
be used as data for the second layer. Two common solutions exist. This
representation can be chosen as being the mean activations
:math:`p(h^{(1)}=1|h^{(0)})` or samples of :math:`p(h^{(1)}|h^{(0)})`.

3. Train the second layer as an RBM, taking the transformed data (samples or
mean activations) as training examples (for the visible layer of that RBM).

4. Iterate (2 and 3) for the desired number of layers, each time propagating
upward either samples or mean values.

5. Fine-tune all the parameters of this deep architecture with respect to a
proxy for the DBN log- likelihood, or with respect to a supervised training
criterion (after adding extra learning machinery to convert the learned
representation into supervised predictions, e.g. a linear classifier).


In this tutorial, we focus on fine-tuning via supervised gradient descent.
Specifically, we use a logistic regression classifier to classify the input
:math:`x` based on the output of the last hidden layer :math:`h^{(l)}` of the
DBN. Fine-tuning is then performed via supervised gradient descent of the
negative log-likelihood cost function. Since the supervised gradient is only
non-null for the weights and hidden layer biases of each layer (i.e. null for
the visible biases of each RBM), this procedure is equivalent to initializing
the parameters of a deep MLP with the weights and hidden layer biases obtained
with the unsupervised training strategy.

Justifying Greedy-Layer Wise Pre-Training
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Why does such an algorithm work ? Taking as example a 2-layer DBN with hidden
layers :math:`h^{(1)}` and :math:`h^{(2)}` (with respective weight parameters
:math:`W^{(1)}` and :math:`W^{(2)}`), [Hinton06]_ established 
(see also Bengio09]_ for a detailed derivation) that :math:`\log
p(x)` can be rewritten as,

.. math::
    :label: dbn_bound

    \log p(x) = &KL(Q(h^{(1)}|x)||p(h^{(1)}|x)) + H_{Q(h^{(1)}|x)} + \\
                &\sum_h Q(h^{(1)}|x)(\log p(h^{(1)}) + \log p(x|h^{(1)})).

:math:`KL(Q(h^{(1)}|x) || p(h^{(1)}|x))` represents the KL divergence between
the posterior :math:`Q(h^{(1)}|x)` of the first RBM if it were standalone, and the
probability :math:`p(h^{(1)}|x)` for the same layer but defined by the entire DBN
(i.e. taking into account the prior :math:`p(h^{(1)},h^{(2)})` defined by the
top-level RBM). :math:`H_{Q(h^{(1)}|x)}` is the entropy of the distribution
:math:`Q(h^{(1)}|x)`. 

It can be shown that if we initialize both hidden layers such that
:math:`W^{(2)}={W^{(1)}}^T`, :math:`Q(h^{(1)}|x)=p(h^{(1)}|x)` and the KL
divergence term is null. If we learn the first level RBM and then keep its
parameters :math:`W^{(1)}` fixed, optimizing Eq. :eq:`dbn_bound` with respect
to :math:`W^{(2)}` can thus only increase the likelihood :math:`p(x)`.  

Also, notice that if we isolate the terms which depend only on :math:`W^{(2)}`, we
get: 

.. math:: 
    \sum_h Q(h^{(1)}|x)p(h^{(1)})
    
Optimizing this with respect to :math:`W^{(2)}` amounts to training a second-stage
RBM, using the output of :math:`Q(h^{(1)}|x)` as the training distribution,
when :math:`x` is sampled from the training distribution for the first RBM.

Implementation
++++++++++++++

To implement DBNs in Theano, we will use the class defined in the :doc:`rbm`
tutorial. One can also observe that the code for the DBN is very similar with the one
for SdA, because both involve the principle of unsupervised layer-wise
pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning as a deep MLP. 
The main difference is that we use the RBM class instead of the dA
class.

We start off by defining the DBN class which will store the layers of the 
MLP, along with their associated RBMs. Since we take the viewpoint of using
the RBMs to initialize an MLP, the code will reflect this by seperating as
much as possible the RBMs used to initialize the network and the MLP used for
classification.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :start-after: start-snippet-1
  :end-before: end-snippet-1

``self.sigmoid_layers`` will store the feed-forward graphs which together form
the MLP, while ``self.rbm_layers`` will store the RBMs used to pretrain each
layer of the MLP.

Next step, we construct ``n_layers`` sigmoid layers (we use the
``HiddenLayer`` class introduced in :ref:`mlp`, with the only modification
that we replaced the non-linearity from ``tanh`` to the logistic function
:math:`s(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}`) and ``n_layers`` RBMs, where ``n_layers``
is the depth of our model.  We link the sigmoid layers such that they form an
MLP, and construct each RBM such that they share the weight matrix and the
hidden bias with its corresponding sigmoid layer.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :start-after: # MLP.
  :end-before: # We now need to add a logistic layer on top of the MLP

All that is left is to stack one last logistic regression layer in order to
form an MLP. We will use the ``LogisticRegression`` class introduced in
:ref:`logreg`. 

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :start-after: # We now need to add a logistic layer on top of the MLP
  :end-before: def pretraining_functions

The class also provides a method which generates training functions for each
of the RBMs. They are returned as a list, where element :math:`i` is a
function which implements one step of training for the ``RBM`` at layer
:math:`i`.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :start-after: self.errors = self.logLayer.errors(self.y)
  :end-before: learning_rate = T.scalar('lr')

In order to be able to change the learning rate during training, we associate a
Theano variable to it that has a default value.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :start-after: index = T.lscalar('index')
  :end-before: def build_finetune_functions

Now any function ``pretrain_fns[i]`` takes as arguments ``index`` and
optionally ``lr`` -- the learning rate. Note that the names of the parameters
are the names given to the Theano variables (e.g. ``lr``) when they are
constructed and not the name of the python variables (e.g. ``learning_rate``). Keep
this in mind when working with Theano. Optionally, if you provide ``k`` (the
number of Gibbs steps to perform in CD or PCD) this will also become an
argument of your function.

In the same fashion, the DBN class includes a method for building the
functions required for finetuning ( a ``train_model``, a ``validate_model``
and a ``test_model`` function). 

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :pyobject: DBN.build_finetune_functions

Note that the returned ``valid_score`` and ``test_score`` are not Theano
functions, but rather Python functions. These loop over the entire 
validation set and the entire test set to produce a list of the losses
obtained over these sets.


Putting it all together
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The few lines of code below constructs the deep belief network : 

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :start-after: # numpy random generator
  :end-before: start-snippet-2

There are two stages in training this network: (1) a layer-wise pre-training and
(2) a fine-tuning stage.

For the pre-training stage, we loop over all the layers of the network. For
each layer, we use the compiled theano function which determines the
input to the ``i``-th level RBM and performs one step of CD-k within this RBM.
This function is applied to the training set for a fixed number of epochs
given by ``pretraining_epochs``.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/DBN.py
  :start-after: start-snippet-2
  :end-before: end-snippet-2

The fine-tuning loop is very similar to the one in the :ref:`mlp` tutorial,
the only difference being that we now use the functions given by
``build_finetune_functions``.

Running the Code
++++++++++++++++

The user can run the code by calling:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  python code/DBN.py

With the default parameters, the code runs for 100 pre-training epochs with
mini-batches of size 10. This corresponds to performing 500,000 unsupervised
parameter updates. We use an unsupervised learning rate of 0.01, with a
supervised learning rate of 0.1.  The DBN itself consists of three
hidden layers with 1000 units per layer. With early-stopping, this configuration
achieved a minimal validation error of 1.27 with corresponding test
error of 1.34 after 46 supervised epochs.

On an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU X5560 running at 2.80GHz, using a multi-threaded MKL
library (running on 4 cores), pretraining took 615 minutes with an average of
2.05 mins/(layer * epoch). Fine-tuning took only 101 minutes or approximately
2.20 mins/epoch.

Hyper-parameters were selected by optimizing on the validation error. We tested
unsupervised learning rates in :math:`\{10^{-1}, ..., 10^{-5}\}` and supervised
learning rates in :math:`\{10^{-1}, ..., 10^{-4}\}`. We did not use any form of
regularization besides early-stopping, nor did we optimize over the number of
pretraining updates.


Tips and Tricks
+++++++++++++++

One way to improve the running time of your code (given that you have
sufficient memory available), is to compute the representation of the entire
dataset at layer ``i`` in a single pass, once the weights of the
:math:`i-1`-th layers have been fixed. Namely, start by training your first
layer RBM. Once it is trained, you can compute the hidden units values for
every example in the dataset and store this as a new dataset which is used to
train the 2nd layer RBM. Once you trained the RBM for layer 2, you compute, in
a similar fashion, the dataset for layer 3 and so on. This avoids calculating
the intermediate (hidden layer) representations, ``pretraining_epochs`` times
at the expense of increased memory usage.
