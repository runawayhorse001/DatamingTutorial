Summary of Data Mining Algorithms

.. note::

   Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated-- idiom, from Sunzi's Art of War 

Although the tutorials presented here is not plan to focuse on the theoretical frameworks of Data Mining, it is still worth to understand 
how they are works and know what's the assumption of those algorithm. This is an important steps to know ourselves.    
 
Diagram of Data Mining Algorithms
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An awesome Tour of Machine Learning Algorithms was published online by `Jason Brownlee`_  in 2013, it still is a good category diagram.
