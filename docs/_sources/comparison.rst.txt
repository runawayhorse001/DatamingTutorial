   Sharpening the knife longer can make it easier to hack the firewood -- old Chinese proverb

There is an old Chinese proverb that Says â€˜sharpening the knife longer can make it easier to hack the firewood'.  In other words, take extra time to get it right in the preparation phase and then the work will be easier. So it is worth to take several minites to think about which programming language is better for you. 

When you google it, you will get many useful results. Here are some valueable information from `Quora`_:

Ponder over questions

My Opinions
+++++++++++
In my opinion, **R** and **Python** are both choice.  Since they are open-source softwares (open-source is always good in my eyes) and are free to download. If you are a beginer without any programming experience and only want to do some data analysis, I would definitely suggest to use **R**. Otherwise, I would suggest to use both.
