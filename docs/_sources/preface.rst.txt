About this tutorial
+++++++++++++++++++

This document is an enhanced extension of my Data Mining Methds & Application (STAT 577) course in University of Tennessee at Knoxville.  **You may download and distribute it. Please be aware, however, that the note contains typos as well as inaccurate or incorrect description. Please give the original author corresponding credit by using thank you email or citations.**  If you find your work wasn't cited in this note, please feel free to let me know.

Although I am by no means an data mining programming expert, I decided that it would be useful for me to share what I learned about data mining programming in the form of easy tutorials with detailed example. I hope those tutorials will be a valuable tool for your studies.

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge of programing and unix. And this document is generated automatically by using `sphinx`_.

Motivation for this tutorial 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Data mining is a relatively new, while the technology is not. Here are the sevaral main motivation for this 
tutorial:

#. It is no exaggeration to say that data mining has thunderstorms impacted on our real lives. I have great interest in data mining and am eager to learn those technologies.
#. Fortunely, I had a chance to register Dr. Haileab Hilafu's Data Mining Methds & Application class. Dr.Haileab Hilafu and his class inspired me to do a better job. 
#. However, I still found that learning data mining programing was a difficult process. I have to Google it and identify which one is true. It was hard to find detailed examples which I can easily learned the full process in one file.  
#. Good sources are expensive for a graduate student.

Acknowledgement
+++++++++++++++

At here, I would like to thank Dr. Haileab Hilafu for providing some of his R code and
homework solutions. I also would like to thank Bo Gao, Le Yin, Chen Wen, Jian Sun and Huan Chen for the valuable disscussion and thank the generous anonymous authors for providing the detailed solutions and source code on the Internet. Without those help, those tutorials would not have been possible to be made. In those tutorials, I try to use the detailed demo code to show how to use each functions in R and Python to do data mining.

Feedback and suggestions
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Your comments and suggestions are highly appreciated. I am more than happy to receive 
corrections, suggestions or feedbacks through email (Wenqiang Feng: von198@gmail.com) for improvements.
