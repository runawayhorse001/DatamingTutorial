This document is a summary of my Data Mining Methds & Application (STAT 577) course in University of Tennessee at Knoxville.  **You may
download and distribute it. Please be aware, however, that the note contains typos as well as inaccurate or
incorrect description.** At here, I would like to thank Dr. Haileab Hilafu for providing some of his R code and
homework solutions. I also would like to thank Bo Gao, Le Yin, Chen Wen, Jian Sun and Huan Chen for the valuable disscussion 
and thank the generous anonymous authors for providing the detailed solutions and source code on the Internet. 
Without those help, those tutorials would not have been possible to be made. In those tutorials, I try to use the 
detailed demo code to show how to use each functions in R and Python to do data mining. If you find your work wasn't cited in
this note, please feel free to let me know.
